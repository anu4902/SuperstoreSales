The project aims to perform analysis on the daily sales data from a US Superstore for a period of four years (2014-2017). The Super Store dataset contains data on order details of customers for orders of a superstore in the US. This includes the order details, customer details, product details, sales, profits etc.
 Data preprocessing is done in Python using pandas.
 Visualization is done using Tableau software to gain deeper insights on the sales data. Since the data is a timeseries data, in order to perform forecasting, Time Series Analysis is done using statsmodels.tsa package in Python. 
Basic data prep required to build a time series model is carried out and various Time Series Models are built to check which model best fits the data. Using the best suited model, sales has been predicted from year 2018-2020.
